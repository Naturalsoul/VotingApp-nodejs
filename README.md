# VotingApp using NodeJS

This a Basejump from [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.com) who challenge to use NodeJS and other stuff to complete it.

## About
This allows you to register, make a poll and vote. The theme of the poll can be any and give you all the options you
want for vote.

## Platform
You can visit [my Dashboard in C9](https://c9.io/naturalsoul) to enter directly to my workspace if you want. Alternatively, you can clone this git and make pull requests.

## Requisites
If you want to collaborate from your PC, you'll need some things to run the project:
  - NodeJS
  - NPM
  - MongoDB
Make sure that you already installed them.

## Footer
You can always contact me if you have some doubts. Happy Coding!! :D
